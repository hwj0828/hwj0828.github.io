Welcome to my personal website! Currently I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania. I'm co-advised by Professor Yong Chen and Professor Yang Ning. Previously I obtained my Ph.D degree in Statistics in 2024 and bachelor's degree in 2019 from Peking University.
