Welcome to my personal website! Currently I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania. I'm co-advised by Professor [Yong Chen](https://penncil.med.upenn.edu/about-pi/) and Professor [Yang Ning](https://yangning.stat.cornell.edu). Previously I obtained my Ph.D degree in Statistics in 2024 and bachelor's degree in 2019 from Peking University. 

My current research focuses on (i) causal inference with unmeasured confounding; (ii) data integration; (iii) high-dimensional statistics. My CV can be downloaded here.
